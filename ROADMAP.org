*** DONE Screenlock
*** TODO Add volume controls to top bar
*** DONE Add screen light control to top bar
*** DONE Add a terminal multiplexer to terminal scratchpad
*** DONE Use a configurable color pallete for all applications
** TODO Setup a local binary cache

This is specially important, where in the new releases on NixOS, it
usually takes time for all binaries to be available. In the recent
upgrade, my less powerful machine, couldn't catch up with all the
builds, and the failures happening every few hours proved to be
frustrating.

On the framework machine, it took a few hours to complete though. So
I'm thinking, of having a [[https://nixos.wiki/wiki/Binary_Cache][binary cache]] on any of my machines, and
exposing them on the network to use as substitutions of the builds,
will help with:

1. Reducing the download time.
2. Reducing the build time.

** DONE Implement home row mods on Linux setup

Currently I'm using a [[https://my.glove80.com/#/layout/user/70648c2c-b1e3-49fd-b359-71f070308654][modified version]] of [[https://github.com/sunaku/glove80-keymaps][Sunaku's]] awesome keyboard
layout on my [[https://www.moergo.com/][Glove80]]. The main improvement for me, apart from having
the ergonomy, is the home row mods. Yesterday, while reading [[https://usesthis.com/interviews/j3s/][Uses
This]], I learned about [[https://github.com/rvaiya/keyd][Keyd]], and man, how did I miss this?

It seems like, it enables the same functionality of framewares like
ZMK, on the normal Linux setup, and it's agnostic from the GUI. This
sounds promissing.

This is specially important/interesting for me, given the fact I
literally dropped my Evil like bindings from the Emacs setup, having
the comfort of the Glove80 setup. However, for <10% of the times, I'm
on my laptop, on the move, and having this, I don't need to crack my
muscle memory to do Ctrl/Alt/Shift with the normal positions.

- Enabling the setup needs to be global and system level. Consequently
  it not only covers the GUI desktop, but also works out of the box on
  TTY.
- The response time seems more effective than what I feel on Glove80.
- While setting up, it's quite important to not make a mistake on
  replace keys for ~overloadt2~'s second argument. Otherwise you can't
  type the targetted characters. I ended up copy/pasting.
** TODO Add a README

After about two years crafting this setup, breaking it many times, and
recovering with no problem, it seems it's becoming stable enough for
me to rely on it for long term. So it just make sense to also put a
proper README on it, for any other interested soul out there.
** TODO Setup AppArmor profiles

** TODO Migrate and the configuration to a MacOS device
This could be useful in settings where using a Mac is mandatory by
client.
