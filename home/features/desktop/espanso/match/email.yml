    Thanks for considering and contacting me.

    Hereby I request you to delete all my records on all your systems and stop any
    further interaction by any purpose on online or offline channels with me.

    Please make sure you carefully read the article 17 of GDPR, "Right to erasure"
    which has been effective since 25 May 2018, so you won''t be fined with severe
    penalties (up to â‚¬20 million, or 4% of the worldwide annual revenue) in case of
    being sued for violating such rights.

    I hope I've informed you, and your legal department enough.
